		<div class="container">
			A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information. <br /><br />

			A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it. <br /><br />

			Tip: Inside a jumbotron you can put nearly any valid HTML, including other Bootstrap elements/classes.<br /><br />

			Use a <mark>div</mark> element with class .jumbotron to create a jumbotron.<br />

			<div class="jumbotron text-center">
				<h1>Jumbotron Inside the container</h1>
				<p>When you want the box within the container, use it within the container div.</p>

			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
